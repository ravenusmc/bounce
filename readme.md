  This is a simple bounce game where the goal is to prevent the ball from hitting the bottom of the screen. I actually started to program this project, on a seperate computer, over 15 months ago. At the time, I never actually got the program to work. It was because I really did not have a good understanding of some concepts-especially classes. Now I build this program and I have little trouble.
